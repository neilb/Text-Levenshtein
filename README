Text::Levenshtein is an implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance in Perl.
A good point to start is: <http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm>

See also Text::WagnerFischer on CPAN for a configurable edit distance. 


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I tested it only under Perl 5.6.

Text::Levenshtein does not use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Text::Levenshtein by running these commands in the *nix environment:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

To install Text::Levenshtein in the Win32 environment, use nmake instead of make.
nmake is available for free (in a self extracting executable):
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe>
After download and inflate, put nmake.exe and nmake.err in c:\windows\command .

POD format documentation is included in Levenshtein.pm.  
POD is readable with the command:

  perldoc Text::Levenshtein
